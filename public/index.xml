      <description>My name is Janet, and I am a junior at Harvard College studying Government with a specialization in data science.
As a Miami native and the daughter of immigrant parents from Cuba and Nicaragua, I have a personal connection to the challenges and opportunities faced by immigrant communities in the city. Through my academic pursuits, I aspire to use data and legal analysis to better understand economic inequality and its effects on social and economic mobility.</description>
