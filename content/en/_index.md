# From Little Havana to South Beach: Assessing the State of the American Dream for Immigrant Communities in Miami.
Welcome to my website, dedicated to exploring the dynamic topic of immigrant mobility and settlement patterns in Miami, Florida. My name is Janet, and I am a junior at Harvard College studying Government with a specialization in data science.

As a Miami native and the daughter of immigrant parents from Cuba and Nicaragua, I have a personal connection to the challenges and opportunities faced by immigrant communities in the city. Through my academic pursuits, I aspire to use data and legal analysis to better understand economic inequality and its effects on social and economic mobility.

This blog serves as a platform to share my research and insights, specifically as a final project for "The Politics of Economic Inequality" seminar at Harvard University. While maintaining a rigorous and scholarly approach, I also recognize the human stories behind the data and aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the various factors influencing immigrant settlement in Miami.

I invite you to explore this website with me and gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of immigrant mobility and settlement patterns in one of America's most diverse cities.
